# SMART-GRAIN-STORAGE-SYSTEM-USING-RASPBERRY-PI-WITH-MOBILE-APPLICATION-CONTROLS

## This projects aims at creating a smart grain storage system with temparature,pressure and humidty monitoring system. Along with monitoring user is also able to control the actuators(In this case a motor) using the android app.
